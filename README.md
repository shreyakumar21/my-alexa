# my-alexa
You can build your own Alexa which could perform the following functions:
1) Play the song that you requested (directs you to a YouTube video)
2) Tell you the current time
3) Give you information that you need (the information exists in 'wikipedia' package)
4) Tell you what date it is today

The project works only when you say 'Alexa', just like how the real Alexa works.
